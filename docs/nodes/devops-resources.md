# DevOps Resources

This section will be provide an overview of different available resources for Node Operators looking to test out Celestia architecture.

## Docker Compose

* One resource for playing with docker-compose for Celestia infrastructure is the [ephemeral-cluster](https://github.com/celestiaorg/ephemeral-cluster) repository. This repository provides infra-as-code specifications on running a docker-compose instance of Celestia devnet. It is not recommended to be used as-is for running nodes individually but can be used as a reference specification for anyone looking to modify it for their own purposes.
