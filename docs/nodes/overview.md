# Overview to Running Nodes on Celestia

There are many ways you can participate in the Celestia network.

Celestia node operators can run several options on the network.

Consensus:

* [Validator Node](../nodes/validator-node.md): Node operators who run a Bridge
  Node have the option to also participate in Consensus by becoming a Validator.

Data Availability:

* [Bridge Node](../nodes/bridge-node.md): This node bridges blocks between the
  Data-Availability network and the Consensus network.
* [Full Node](../nodes/full-node.md): This node stores all the data but does
  not connect to Consensus.
* [Light Node](../nodes/light-node.md): Light clients conduct data availability
  sampling on the Data Availability network.

You can learn more about how to setup each different node by going through
this tutorial guide.

Both Bridge and Validator nodes are part of the same section.
Light Clients have their own section.

Please provide any feedback on the tutorials and guides. If you notice
a bug or issue, feel free to make a Pull Request or write up a Github
Issue ticket!
