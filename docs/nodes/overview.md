# Overview to Running Nodes on Celestia

There are many ways you can participate in the Celestia network.

Celestia node operators can run several options on the network:

* Bridge Node (This node bridges blocks between the Data-Availability network
  and the Consensus network)
* Validator Node (Node operators who run a Bridge Node have the option to also
  participate in Consensus by becoming a validator)
* Light Client (Light clients conduct data availability sampling on the Data
  Availability network)

You can learn more about how to setup each different node by going through
this tutorial guide.

Both Bridge and Validator nodes are part of the same section.
Light Clients have their own section.

Please provide any feedback on the tutorials and guides. If you notice
a bug or issue, feel free to make a Pull Request or write up a Github
Issue ticket!
