# Overview to Running Nodes on Celestia 

There are many ways you can participate in the Celestia network.

Celestia node operators can run several options on the network:
* Bridge Node (This node allows bridging between the Data-Availability Layer and the Consensus Layer)
* Validator Node (Node operators who run a Bridge Node have the option to also participate in Consensus by becoming a validator)
* Light Client (Light clients allow for data-sampling on the Data Availability Layer)

You can learn more about how to setup each different node by going through this tutorial guide.

Both Bridge and Validator nodes are part of the same section.
Light Clients have their own section.

Please provide any feedback on the tutorials and guides. If you notice a bug or issue, feel free to make a Pull Request or write up a Github Issue ticket!
