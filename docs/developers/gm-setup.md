## üèÉ¬†Install Golang

Celestia-App, Celestia-Node, and Cosmos-SDK are written in the Golang
programming language. We‚Äôll need Golang to build and run them. **Be sure to use the same testnet installation instructions through this entire tutorial.**

You can [install Golang here](./environment.mdx#install-golang).

## üî•¬†Install Ignite CLI

First, you will need to create `/usr/local/bin` if you have not already:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p -m 775 /usr/local/bin
```

The most stable version of Ignite CLI is v0.24.0. You can install Ignite
Version v0.24.0 from source by running the following commands:

```bash
wget https://github.com/ignite/cli/archive/refs/tags/v0.24.0.zip
unzip v0.24.0.zip
cd cli-0.24.0
make install
which ignite
ignite version
```

> ‚úã On some machines, you may run into permissions errors.
You can resolve this error by following the guidance
[here](https://docs.ignite.com/guide/install#write-permission).

A successful installation will return something similar the response below:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD010 -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```bash
jcs @ ~/cli-0.24.0 % make install
