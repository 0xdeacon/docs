# ðŸ¥— Introduction

In this tutorial, weâ€™re going to build a blockchain for your favorite recipes. The goal tutorial is to create a Rollmint rollup with a module that allows you to write and read data from your application-specific blockchain. The end user will be able to submit new recipes and read them from the blockchain.

In the [`gm world` tutorial](./gm-world), we defined a new API endpoint and modified a keeper query function to return static data. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll be modifying the state with transactions (Cosmos SDK messages) that are routed to a module and its message handlers, which are sent to the `recipes` blockchain.
