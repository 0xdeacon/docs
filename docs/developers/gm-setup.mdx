programming language. You will need Golang to build and run them.

entire tutorial**

You can [install Golang here](./environment.mdx#install-golang).

## 🔥 Install Ignite CLI

First, you will need to create `/usr/local/bin` if you have not already:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p -m 775 /usr/local/bin
```

Run this command in your terminal to install Ignite CLI:

```bash
curl https://get.ignite.com/cli! | bash
```

> ✋ On some machines, you may run into permissions errors like the one below.
You can resolve this error by following the guidance
[here](https://docs.ignite.com/guide/install#write-permission) or below.

```bash
# Error
jcs @ ~ % curl https://get.ignite.com/cli! | bash
