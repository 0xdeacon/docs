# 🏗 Scaffolding your `recipes` Rollup with Ignite and Rollmint

Run the following command to scaffold your `recipes` chain:

```bash
ignite scaffold chain recipes --address-prefix recipes
```

Your new `recipes` chain has been scaffolded and `--address-prefix recipes` allows the address prefix to be `recipes` instead of `cosmos`. 

Change into the `recipes` directory:

```bash
cd recipes
```

## 💎 Installing Rollmint
To swap out Tendermint for Rollmint, run the following command:

```sh
go mod edit -replace github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk=github.com/celestiaorg/cosmos-sdk-rollmint@v0.46.3-rollmint-v0.4.0
go mod tidy
go mod download
```
