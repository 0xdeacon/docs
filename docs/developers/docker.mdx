# üê≥ Docker Setup

This page has instructions to run `celestia-node` using Docker. If you are looking for instructions to run `celestia-node` using a binary, please refer to the [Celestia Node](./celestia-node.mdx) page.

Using Docker is the easiest way to run `celestia-node` for most users. Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to run `celestia-node` in an isolated environment. This means that you can run `celestia-node` on your machine without having to worry about installing and configuring all of the dependencies required to run the node.

The easiest way to install Docker is to use the official Docker Desktop installer. You can find the instructions for your operating system [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and basic understanding of Docker
