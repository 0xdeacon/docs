# ðŸ¥— Recipe Book Overview

## ðŸ“– Overview

In this tutorial, we are going to build a blockchain
for your favorite recipes. The goal of this tutorial
is to create a Rollmint rollup with a module that allows
you to write and read data to and from your application-specific
blockchain. The end user will be able to submit new
recipes and read them from the blockchain.

In the [`gm world` tutorial](./gm-world/), we defined a
new API endpoint and modified a keeper query function
to return static data. In this tutorial, we will be
modifying the state with transactions (Cosmos SDK messages)
that are routed to a module and its message handlers, which
are sent to the `recipes` blockchain.

:::danger caution

The script for this tutorial is built for Mocha Testnet.
If you choose to use Arabica Devnet,
you will need to modify the script manually.
