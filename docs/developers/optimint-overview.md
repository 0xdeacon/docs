# Optimint

Optimint is an Optimistic-Rollup implementation of
ABCI (Application Blockchain Interface) in
order to build sovereign chains using the Cosmos-SDK
for Celestia.

It is built by replacing Tendermint, the Cosmos-SDK
consensus layer, with a drop-in replacement that
communicates directly with Celestia's Data Availability layer.

## Tutorials

The following tutorials will help you get started building
Cosmos-SDK applications that connect to Celestia's Data Availability
Layer via Optimint. We call those chains Sovereign Rollups.

You can get started with the following tutorials:

- [Wordle Game](./wordle.md)
- [CosmWasm Tutorial](./cosmwasm.md)
